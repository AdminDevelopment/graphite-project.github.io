      <h3 class="section-subhead">How can I view my Graphite metrics?</h3>

      <p>If getting metrics <em>into</em> Graphite is a walk in the park, then getting them <em>out</em> is like taking candy from a baby, on a swing, in that same park. Although the Graphite <a href="http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/render_api.html">render API</a> is a great way to retrieve graphs or metrics, and the <a href="http://grafana.org/">Grafana</a> project is undoubtedly first-in-class for Graphite user interfaces, diving into the Graphite Composer is usually the quickest way to introduce yourself to Graphite's visualization capabilities.</p>

      <h3>The Composer Window</h3>

      <p>The main Composer window includes a blank graph which acts as a canvas for your metrics. On the left, you'll find a navigation tree containing all of your metrics (and saved graphs) in a heirarchy mapping to their dot-delimited namespace.</p>

      <h3>Adding metrics to a graph</h3>

      <p>Clicking on a metric will add (or remove) it to the graph. Here we can see the <strong><tt>collectd.graphite.memory.memory-buffered</tt></strong> metric rendered as a line chart and a legend added to the bottom of the graph. The y-axis tracks the values recorded, and the x-axis displays the time range.</p>

      <p>Selecting the other memory metrics will add them to the graph too. This is a great way to correlate different metrics at the same time.</p>

      <h3>Stacked graphs</h3>

      <p>But what if we wanted to see the total memory footprint for this graph? Fortunately, Graphite has support for <strong>stacked charts</strong>. Enabling the <strong>Stacked</strong> option under the <strong>Area Mode</strong> graph options menu will cause all of our metrics to stack upon each other in the same graph.</p>

      <h3>Area graph transparency</h3>

      <p>Awesome. Although admittedly it could stand for a bit less <em>psychedelicity</em> (if that's not a word, it totally should be). Let's increase the transparency by adjusting the graph <strong>Filled Area Alpha Value</strong>. In this example I've lowered it to <strong><tt>0.4</tt></strong> (1.0 is considered fully opaque).</p>

      <h3>Down the rabbit hole</h3>

      <p>This is a very shallow first look at some of Graphite's graphing and output capabilities. If you haven't already, you should definitely check out more of the <a href="http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/render_api.html">render API's capabilities</a> and Graphite's huge library of <a href="http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html">transformative and statistical functions</a>.</p>

      <p>If you'd like to try out a more modern UI for Graphite, the Grafana project offers their own <a href="http://play.grafana.org/">interactive sandbox</a>. This is another great way to interact with your Graphite data and it offers many more visualization types than the native Composer.</p>
